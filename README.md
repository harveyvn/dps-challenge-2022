In this repo, I provided the commands and source code to deploy three Machine Learning models utilizing the platform Vertex AI to build an end-to-end machine learning workflow.

- Folder `mission_01/`: The machine learning model is based on the pre-trained model from `io-vertex-codelab`.
- Folder `mission_01_custom/`: The custom machine learning model uses the Auto MPG dataset from Kaggle to predict the fuel efficiency of a vehicle using a basic regression with TensorFlow.
- Folder `mission_01_bonus/`: The custom machine learning model uses the Sale Price dataset from Kaggle to predict the sale price of a specific house using a basic regression with TensorFlow.

For each folder, you can find the step by step in order to build and deploy your machine learning model in detail.
